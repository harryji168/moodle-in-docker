# Moodle 4.2.1 Docker-Composer Environment

This Git repository hosts a Docker-Composed environment for Moodle 4.2.1, an open-source Learning Management System (LMS) platform. 

The aim of this repository is to provide a straightforward, reproducible setup that makes it easy to run Moodle 4.2.1 in a Docker environment, aiding in development, testing, and possibly even production usage.

## Features:

1. **Ease of Setup:** The Docker-Composer configuration makes it easy to get Moodle 4.2.1 up and running without the need for manually setting up a server environment.

2. **Portability:** Docker allows you to build and run the same setup across multiple platforms, making this solution highly portable and platform-agnostic.

3. **Isolation:** Docker's inherent architecture keeps your Moodle instance separate from the host system, mitigating the risk of conflicting dependencies and providing a consistent environment.

4. **Reproducibility:** This setup can be version-controlled, shared, and replicated easily among different development environments, ensuring consistency.

## Components:
This Docker-Compose configuration consists of the following services:

1. **Web Server:** Running Apache/NGINX to serve the Moodle application.
2. **PHP-FPM:** PHP processing for the Moodle application.
3. **Database Server:** Running a MySQL/PostgreSQL instance to store Moodle data.
4. **phpMyAdmin:** (optional) A web interface for managing the MySQL database.

Please refer to the README for detailed instructions on how to use and customize this setup. Enjoy developing with Moodle 4.2.1 in a Docker environment!
